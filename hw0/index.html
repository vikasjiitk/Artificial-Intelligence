Reasonable Part</b></u></h4>	In the straight-forward, simple and normal conversation, program tends to give fairly enough reasonable answers.<br>	(<a href="reasonable_talk.txt">file link</a>)<br>	<iframe src="reasonable_talk.txt" width="700px" height="300px"></iframe>	<br><br>	<h4><u><b>1. Unreasonable Part</b></u></h4>	In the following conservation which also seems to be very normal program shows various defects and commit many mistakes leading to a nonsensical conversation.<br>	(<a href="unreasonable_talk.txt">file link</a>)<br>	<iframe src="unreasonable_talk.txt" width="700px" height="300px"></iframe>		<p><b>Initially unreasonable part converstaion goes well but later it goes completely off-track due to following reasons.</b>		<ul>			<li> First of all, program does not recognise which type is 'girlfriend' since it has a predefined list of types and 'girlfriend' is not present in any.</li>			<li>Since it does not recognize he type it starts asking common questions such as about my life and about my plans.</li>			<li> It doesn't get anything from the answers of common questions because answers involve 'girlfriend'</li>			<li> It again asks about the reason of depression but when say 'its due to girlfriend' it again can not categorize it and keep asking common questions make from complete answers.</li>			<li>When it does not get any link, due to use of words 'miserable' and 'annoying' in my answers it concludes that its due to 'school'. </li>			<li>Even on refusing that I do not go to School, It keep bringing questions on School since I was using the word 'School' in each answer in negation.</li>			<li>When I does not respond to it's school's questions well, it again asks about my deprsession and once again I tell it but still it does not recognise it and again asks the same questions.</li>		</p>		<br>		<p><u><b>Improvemnts</b></u><br>			<li>Program needs more vocabulary words for different scenarios. </li>			<li>It also needs to convert verbs and other grammatical forms affectively.</li>			<li>The parsing method should be improved as negative sentences are also considering as positive.</li>			<li>Program answer is mainly based on previous response and it repeats the same question again and again. Program should take into account whole conversation.</li>		</p>		<br></html>
